# BMI_ML_noCalculation
ML Based BMI Model
Case1: We were provided by Real time BMI Data of X Area and we needed to generate a BMI Machine learning model for That Dataset.
We are providing final model for that and We considered basic parameters i.e. Height and weight,
We interagted a simple GUI for easier use.
Implemented pickle & unpickle On model with accuracy more than 95% model
This Model is purely made for Learning Purpose and feel free to contact in case of any issue (Anumayank1999@gmail.com)
